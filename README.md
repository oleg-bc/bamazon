# bamazon
NodeJS CLI app - that demonstrates CRUD with mySQL db

Below GIF runs thru the most basic case scenario: 
1. user gets a list of items upon program execution. Items come from mySQL db.
2. User is prompted to select an item for purchase
3. After selecting a valid item the user is prompted to select an amount of items.
4. Error checking validates that amount is in stock, by checking the DB for quantity on hand.
5. If item's out of stock the user gets an informative message.
6. If item's in stock a sale completion message gets displayed.

--------------requirements to be replaced--------------
This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a README.md file.


Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the customer and if relevant the manager/supervisor). This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options).
Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works. 
Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading.
